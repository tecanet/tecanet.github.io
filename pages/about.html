          Tamu (Gurung) Educational and Career Advancement Network Nepal (TECANET)
          is an informal platform to share and exchange experiences and expertise
          in an effort to address the challenges faced by the majority of
          Tamu Youth in their education and career advancement.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          Established in 2004, this network was conceived by the Tamu professionals
          from the USA and Nepal with the objective of extending substantial support
          to the upcoming young Gurungs (students and professionals), to expand and
          to strengthen network among the Tamu professionals.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          Tamus are increasingly venturing into sectors other than the predominant
          British Gurkha army and agricultural sector. After the 1990s, there has
          been a significant increase in the number of Tamus pursuing higher studies.
          Many are exploring opportunities for themselves as students, professionals
          and as entrepreneurs in different sectors - dealing with the challenges in
          today's competitive world.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          The interaction programme held on 26 December 2004, confirmed that there
          was a need to support the students and young Tamu professionals for their
          education and career development and more so in employment opportunities.
          It was pertinent to build a network to share and exchange experiences and
          expertise to give direction and to provide support to each other.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          Sharing the success stories of renowned Tamu professionals as role models
          and catalysts can help to inspire, boost self confidence and encourage
          the younger Tamu generation in taking up active roles in their personal
          as well as community development.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          TECANET has now been registered on March 12, 2009 (BS Falgun 29, 2065) as
          per the Institution Registration Act 2034. However, the working principal
          of TECANET will remain informal and apolitical, with the main aim of
          supporting and encouraging the educational and career endeavours of the Tamu youth.
